<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
This Python-based MasterMind game is a text-based simulation of the original board game. The computer generates a random 4-color code, and the user is given 10 tries to guess it correctly.<br>

After each guess, the program provides feedback:<br>
How many colors are correct and in the correct position.<br>
How many colors are correct but in the wrong position.<br>

Valid Colors:<br>
- R - Red<br>
- G - Green<br>
- B - Blue<br>
- Y - Yellow<br>
- W - White<br>
- O - Orange<br>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="problem"></a>Problem</h2>
Building this game poses several challenges from both a game logic and user experience standpoint:<br>

- Ensuring a fair, random generation of color codes without repetition (optional).<br>
- Validating user input to ensure:<br>
   - Correct number of colors guessed.<br>
   - All guessed colors are from the valid color list.<br>
- Providing feedback that helps players logically deduce the correct answer.<br>
- Handling case-insensitive inputs and spacing issues.<br>
- Giving players a smooth experience via loop-based gameplay and limited attempts.<br>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="tools"></a>Tools</h2>
This project is built using Python 3, and makes use of the following standard tools:<br>

- random: To generate the secret code by randomly selecting colors.<br>
- input(): To collect user guesses.<br>
- print(): To communicate feedback.<br>
- Loops and dictionaries: For logic handling and feedback generation.<br>
- if __name__ == "__main__": To safely encapsulate the game execution.<br>

No external libraries are required.<br>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="key-things"></a>Key Things</h2>

### Code Length & Tries**<br>

- The secret code is 4 colors long.<br>
- You get 10 attempts to guess the correct code.<br>

### Valid Colors
- The set of valid color initials is: ['R', 'G', 'B', 'Y', 'W', 'O'].<br>

### Feedback Logic<br>
- Correct Positions: Number of colors guessed correctly and in the correct position.<br>
- Incorrect Positions: Number of colors that exist in the code but are in the wrong position.<br>

### Input Validation<br>
- The program checks that your guess contains exactly 4 colors.<br>
- It ensures all colors are from the allowed list.<br>
- Case insensitive: you can type r g b y or R G B Y.<br>

### Replay Safety<br>
- The secret code is re-generated at the start of each new game.<br>
- If the player runs out of tries, the actual code is revealed.<br>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="how-to-run-this-program"></a>How to run this program</h2>

#### Prerequisites<br>
- Install Python (preferably Python 3.x): https://www.python.org/downloads/<br>

#### Clone or Download the Project<br>
- You can clone it using Git or simply download the .py file.<br>
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MasterMind_Game.git<br>
- Change directory to where you cloned the game in local directory<br>

#### Run the Game<br>
- Use your terminal or command prompt:<br>
- run the file<br>

#### Play the Game<br>
- You'll see a prompt asking you to guess 4 colors.<br>
- Type your guess using space-separated letters (e.g., R G B Y).<br>
- You'll get feedback after each try.<br>


<h2><a class="anchor" id="recommendations"></a>Recommendations</h2>
Here are some tips and ideas for improving or modifying the game:<br>

### For Players:<br>
- Try to use logic from previous feedback.<br>
- Track which positions and colors you’ve already tested.<br>

### For Developers:<br>
- Add an option to allow repeated colors in the code.<br>
- Allow full color names as input (e.g., RED, GREEN) with smart mapping.<br>
- Add a GUI using tkinter, pygame, or PyQt.<br>
- Track player statistics in a file (e.g., number of wins, average tries).<br>
- Add multiplayer or versus computer modes.<br>
- Add unit tests to validate feedback logic and edge cases.<br>
